# Chromatin to splicing
Bioinformatics project analysing genomic data from [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.internationalgenome.org/). Investigating relationship between open chromatin and alternative splicing. Aiming to better understand modes of gene expression regulation. Part of a bachelor's project at University of Tartu.

Analysing data from ATAC, RNA, ChIP sequencing. Using mainly genomic packages in R and various command line tools such as [QTLTools](https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/), [Bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html). Workflow controlled by Snakemake scripts, which are based on [this](https://github.com/kauralasoo/RNAseq_pipeline/blob/master/quantify_transcription_SE.snakefile)
